- **Infrastructure**: Unreliable electricity, poor internet connectivity
- **Time constraints**: Heavy workload, administrative duties
- **Diverse student levels**: Wide range of learning abilities in one class

---

## 🔴 CRITICAL ISSUES (Must Fix)

### 1. **OFFLINE FUNCTIONALITY - CRITICAL GAP** ⚠️
**Problem:** Rural areas have unreliable internet. Teachers can't use the app when needed most.

**Current State:** Fully online, requires constant internet connection

**Impact:** 
- App is useless during power cuts (common in rural areas)
- Can't prepare lessons at home without internet
- Wastes precious time waiting for connectivity

**Solution Needed:**
- ✅ Progressive Web App (PWA) with offline mode
- ✅ Cache generated content for offline access
- ✅ Download lesson plans/quizzes as PDFs for offline use
- ✅ Sync when internet is available

**Priority:** 🔴 CRITICAL - Without this, app has limited real-world utility

---

### 2. **CURRICULUM ALIGNMENT - MAJOR GAP** ⚠️
**Problem:** Content doesn't align with NCERT/State Board syllabi

**Current State:** Generic topics, no curriculum mapping

**Impact:**
- Teachers can't trust the content for exams
- Doesn't match textbook chapters
- Wastes time adapting generic content to syllabus

**What's Missing:**
- ❌ No NCERT chapter-wise content
- ❌ No state board (Maharashtra, UP, Bihar, etc.) alignment
- ❌ No learning outcomes mapping (as per NEP 2020)
- ❌ No competency-based questions

**Solution Needed:**
- ✅ Add NCERT chapter selector for each subject
- ✅ Map to specific learning outcomes
- ✅ Include state board variations
- ✅ Tag content with competencies (NEP 2020)
- ✅ Reference textbook page numbers

**Priority:** 🔴 CRITICAL - Teachers need exam-aligned content

---

### 3. **LANGUAGE & LOCALIZATION - INADEQUATE** ⚠️
**Problem:** Current multilingual support is superficial

**Current State:** UI translated, but content quality varies

**Issues:**
- Content in regional languages often feels "translated" not "native"
- No support for code-mixing (Hindi-English, common in rural schools)
- No regional examples (uses generic Western examples)
- No local context (Indian festivals, crops, geography)

**What Rural Teachers Need:**
- ✅ Content that uses LOCAL examples (not "pizza" but "roti", not "snow" but "monsoon")
- ✅ Regional language content that feels natural
- ✅ Code-mixing support (Hinglish, Tanglish, etc.)
- ✅ Audio support for low-literacy students
- ✅ Simple language options (avoid complex English)

**Priority:** 🟠 HIGH - Language is a major barrier

---

### 4. **RESOURCE CONSTRAINTS NOT ADDRESSED** ⚠️
**Problem:** Assumes resources that rural schools don't have

**Current Issues:**
- Lesson plans suggest materials not available (projectors, computers, lab equipment)
- Activities require internet (videos, online simulations)
- No low-cost/no-cost alternatives suggested

**What's Needed:**
- ✅ "Zero-cost" lesson plan option (using only chalk, blackboard, locally available items)
- ✅ Suggest alternatives: "If no projector, use chart paper"
- ✅ Activities using local materials (stones for math, leaves for science)
- ✅ Offline activities that don't need electricity

**Priority:** 🟠 HIGH - Makes content actually usable

---

## 🟡 MAJOR IMPROVEMENTS NEEDED

### 5. **DIFFERENTIATED INSTRUCTION - MISSING**
**Problem:** One-size-fits-all content for diverse classrooms

**Reality:** In one class:
- Some students can't read properly

- Wide age range (12-16 year olds in same grade)

**What's Missing:**
- ❌ No remedial content for struggling students
- ❌ No advanced content for fast learners
- ❌ No multi-level activities for same topic

**Solution:**
- ✅ Generate 3 difficulty levels for each topic
- ✅ Remedial worksheets for basics
- ✅ Extension activities for advanced students
- ✅ Peer teaching activities (advanced help struggling)

**Priority:** 🟡 MEDIUM-HIGH

---

### 6. **ASSESSMENT QUALITY - NEEDS WORK**
**Problem:** Quizzes don't match exam patterns

**Current State:** Generic MCQs, short answers

**What's Missing:**
- ❌ No board exam pattern questions
- ❌ No marking scheme (how to award partial marks)
- ❌ No difficulty progression (easy → medium → hard)
- ❌ No previous year question patterns

**Solution:**
- ✅ Add "Board Exam Style" quiz option
- ✅ Include marking schemes
- ✅ Add difficulty levels
- ✅ Reference previous year questions
- ✅ Include diagram-based questions (common in Indian exams)

**Priority:** 🟡 MEDIUM-HIGH

---

### 7. **PRACTICAL RELEVANCE - WEAK**

- Practical applications (how math helps in farming, selling)
- Local heroes and role models (not just Western scientists)

**Solution:**
- ✅ Add "Rural Context" option in prompts
- ✅ Use local examples by default
- ✅ Connect to students' daily lives
- ✅ Include local success stories

**Priority:** 🟡 MEDIUM

---

### 8. **TIME EFFICIENCY - POOR**
**Problem:** Takes too long to generate content

**Current State:** 15-30 seconds per generation

**Reality:** Teachers have 5-10 minutes between classes to prepare

**What's Needed:**
- ✅ Quick templates for common topics
- ✅ Pre-generated content library (downloadable)
- ✅ Batch generation (generate week's content at once)
- ✅ Favorites/bookmarks for frequently used content

**Priority:** 🟡 MEDIUM

---

## 🟢 FEATURE GAPS

### 9. **MISSING CRITICAL FEATURES**

#### A. **Parent Communication** (Very Important in Rural Areas)
- ❌ No parent-friendly summaries (in simple language)
- ❌ No homework assignments parents can understand
- ❌ No progress reports in regional languages

**Why Critical:** Parents in rural areas often can't help with homework because they don't understand English/complex topics.

#### B. **Peer Collaboration**
