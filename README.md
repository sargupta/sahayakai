## Localization

A core principle of this application is to provide a fully localized experience.

**Guideline:** All pages, features, and components must show content and generate content based on the user's selected language. This applies to UI text, placeholder text, examples, and all AI-generated materials. Ensure any new feature or component adheres to this principle.
