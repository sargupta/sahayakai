| **0:15-0:25** | **Left:** Teacher trying to translate an English textbook into Hindi, looking confused. <br> **Right:** Teacher speaks: *"Isko Hindi mein samjhao"* (Explain this in Hindi).

Not anymore.)* <br> **SFX:** Robot voice vs. Warm, human-like voice. |

### Production Notes for SARGVISION Team:
*   **The Actor:** Use a relatable face (middle-aged, simple clothes), not a model.
*   **The Setting:** Background must look like a real government school (peeling paint is okay), not an international school.
*   **The Tone:** Empowering, not mocking the "Old Way." We feel *empathy* for the tired teacher, not contempt.
