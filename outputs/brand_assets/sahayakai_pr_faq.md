## PRESS RELEASE

**SARGVISION Unveils SahayakAI: India’s First "Pedagogical Operating System" That Turns Every Rural Smartphone Into a Super-Teacher**

**BANGALORE, India — January 26, 2027** — Today, SARGVISION AI announced the launch of **SahayakAI**, a voice-first, offline-capable AI assistant designed specifically for the 9.7 million teachers in India’s rural heartland. By combining "Frugal AI" engineering with deep cultural localization, SahayakAI aims to end the "Quality Paradox" in Indian education—where physical access to schools is universal, but quality learning remains a privilege of the urban elite.

For decades, the rural Indian teacher has been fighting a losing battle. Overburdened by administrative paperwork, managing multi-grade classrooms, and teaching from textbooks that use alien urban concepts (like "subways" and "dollars"), they have had little time or support to actually teach.

SahayakAI changes this equation instantly. It is not just an app; it is a **Civilizational Intelligence Infrastructure**.

"We realized that the 'Digital Divide' wasn't just about internet access; it was about *Cognitive Sovereignty*," said **Abhishek Gupta**, Founder & CEO of SARGVISION. "A teacher in a remote village in Raichur shouldn't have to translate Western concepts for her students. SahayakAI brings the power of world-class generative AI to the edge, making it speak the language, metaphors, and reality of rural India. We aren't replacing teachers; we are giving them an exoskeleton."

**The "Super Teacher" Experience**
Imagine Rajeshwari, a government school teacher in a low-connectivity village in Karnataka. She has to teach "Fractions" to a class of 40 students but has only 10 minutes to prepare.
*   **Before SahayakAI:** She relies on a dusty textbook example about cutting a pizza—a food her students have never seen.
*   **With SahayakAI:** She opens the app (which works offline) and simply speaks in Kannada: *"Sahayak, prepare a rigorous lesson plan for Class 5 Math on Fractions, using examples from our local harvest."*
*   **The Magic:** Within seconds, SahayakAI generates a complete lesson plan. It suggests explaining fractions using a "Bigha" of land divided for different crops (Wheat vs. Bajra). It creates an activity using locally available stones instead of plastic lab kits. It even drafts a quiz.

This is made possible by SahayakAI’s proprietary **"Context Engine,"** which actively rewrites generic AI responses into culturally grounded pedagogy.

**Key Innovations:**
*   **Voice-As-Code:** No typing required. If a teacher can speak to a student, they can use SahayakAI.
*   **Zero-Data Architecture:** Built as a Hybrid Offline PWA, the AI’s core reasoning engine runs locally on basic smartphones (2GB RAM), ensuring it works even when the internet doesn't.
*   **Institutional Alignment:** Fully compliant with NEP 2020 and NDEAR standards, ensuring seamless integration with government infrastructure.

"SahayakAI is the 'Google Maps' for pedagogy," said Dr. Ramdas Pai Chair on Education. "Just as Maps made every driver an expert navigator, SahayakAI makes every educator an expert teacher."

Starting today, SahayakAI is rolling out to 5,000 pioneer teachers across Karnataka, Uttar Pradesh, and West Bengal, with a goal to unlock **6 Billion Learning Hours** by 2030.

**Availability:**
SahayakAI is available immediately for State Government partners and registered schools. For more information, visit [www.sahayak.ai](http://www.sahayak.ai).

## INTERNAL FAQ (The Hard Questions)

**Q1: Why build our own "Context Engine"? Why not just prompt Gemini/GPT-4 to "act like an Indian teacher"?**
**A:** "Prompt engineering" is fragile. A generic LLM might hallucinate or revert to Western defaults (e.g., using "miles" instead of "kilometers") when the context gets complex. Our **"Context Engine"** is deterministic infrastructure. It uses a proprietary knowledge graph of 50,000+ verified Indian mappings (e.g., specific crop cycles for specific districts). This ensures **Pedagogical Sovereignty**—we don't rely on a San Francisco model to know what a "Kharif crop" is; we own that truth.

**Q2: Educational tools rarely monetize. How do we survive?**
**A:** We are not a B2C "Homework Helper" app. We are a B2G (Business to Government) Infrastructure play.
*   **Revenue Model:** We charge State Governments a per-teacher annual license fee (creating high-margin recurring revenue).
*   **Moat:** By integrating with NDEAR and DIKSHA (national platforms), we become a line item in the State Budget, similar to how textbooks are procured. This creates 5-10 year lock-in contracts, unlike the churn-heavy B2C ed-tech model.

**Q3: Internet in rural India is improving (5G). Is "Offline-First" really a long-term moat?**
**A:** Yes. "Coverage" does not equal "Reliability." In a classroom, a 5-second buffer is a disruption. A 5-minute outage is a lesson killer. Furthermore, our **"Frugal Semantic Caching"** reduces API costs by 68% by processing repetitive queries on-device. Even if internet is free and perfect, our architecture is cheaper and faster. Efficiency is a permanent moat.

**Q4: Teachers fear AI will replace them. How do we drive adoption?**
**A:** We explicitly position SahayakAI as a **"Co-Pilot," not an "Auto-Pilot."**
*   **Design Choice:** The "Mandatory Teacher Review" step. The AI produces a *draft*, and the teacher *must* approve it. This keeps the teacher in the position of authority ("The Village Elder").
*   **Value Prop:** We sell "Time," not "Intelligence." We emphasize that we save them 200 hours of *admin* work (paperwork, reporting) so they can do more *teaching*.

**Q5: What prevents a giant like Google or Reliance from copying this?**
**A:**
1.  **Data Advantage:** They have the "General web." We have the "Dark Data" of rural pedagogy—100,000+ successful lesson plans interactions that show exactly *how* a teacher in Raichur explains gravity effectively. This feedback loop creates a data flywheel they cannot scrape.
2.  **Trust Network:** Our "Mediated Trust" model works through the State Department hierarchy. A teacher uses us because the District Magistrate endorsed it, not because they saw an ad. This B2G distribution channel is hard for tech giants to penetrate without years of groundwork.

## EXTERNAL FAQ (Customer/Public)

**Q1: Is SahayakAI just a translation tool?**
**A:** No. Translation changes words; SahayakAI changes *concepts*. If a textbook explains physics using a rollercoaster (which a village child hasn't seen), SahayakAI rewrites the lesson to explain the same physics using a bullock cart or a water pump. It "localizes" the logic, not just the language.

**Q2: Does it work on old phones?**
**A:** Yes. We obsessively engineered SahayakAI to run on devices with as little as **2GB RAM**. We shouldn't punish teachers for having older hardware. If you can run WhatsApp, you can run SahayakAI.

**Q3: Can parents use it?**
**A:** Indirectly, yes! SahayakAI has a **"Parent Bridge"** feature. After a teacher finishes a lesson, the AI can automatically generate a simple SMS summary in the local language sent to parents (e.g., *"Today your child learned about water conservation. Ask them to show you how to save water at the tap!"*). This keeps illiterate or semi-literate parents in the loop.

**Q4: Is it safe? Does it hallucinate?**
**A:** Safety is our #1 priority.
1.  **Curriculum Guardrails:** The AI is strictly bounded by the State Board curriculum. It cannot "make up" facts outside the textbook.
2.  **NeMo Guardrails:** We use advanced industry-standard filters to block inappropriate content.
3.  **Human-in-the-Loop:** No content is shown to a student until the teacher reviews and approves it.

**Q5: Which languages does it support?**
**A:** At launch, we support **English, Hindi, and Kannada**. By the end of 2027, we will expand to **Bengali, Telugu, Tamil, and Marathi**, covering 70% of India's student population.

**Q6: How much does it cost the teacher?**
**A:** **Zero.** SahayakAI is free for government school teachers. We partner with State Governments and CSR foundations to cover the costs, ensuring that no teacher is denied access due to lack of funds.
