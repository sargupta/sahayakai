**Subject:** Request for Guidance: Building Sovereign AI for Rural Dialects (SahayakAI)

Respected Dr. Mitesh Khapra and Dr. Pratyush Kumar,

Namaste.

I am writing to you with great admiration for the seminal work AI4Bharat is doing for our nation. As the founder of **SahayakAI**, a small initiative focused on rural education, I look up to your efforts with **IndicVoices** and **IndicWhisper** as the true "Civilizational Infrastructure" for Bharat.

**Our Humble Submission**
While AI4Bharat has laid the foundational digital highways for our languages, we have observed a critical opportunity in the "last mile" of rural education. In districts like Raichur, teachers speak in unique dialects and accents that are often distinct from standard language models.

**Seeking Your Guidance on Data & Sovereignty**
We have an operational platform where rural teachers will be speaking daily—generating a rich stream of natural, accented speech across various dialects.

We wish to seek your guidance on **how such data could be leveraged to build a truly Sovereign AI model that handles these local dialects and accents.**

specifically:
1.  **Data Collection:** In a scenario where we can collect samples of diverse accents and dialects from our platform, what methodology would you advise us to follow?
2.  **Mutual Benefit:** How can we structure this data flow so that it strengthens the open-source Indic ecosystem while also helping us serve these teachers better?

We are not experts in speech signal processing; we are builders hoping to contribute to the national mission. We would be deeply grateful for your advice on how we might collaborate to ensure this valuable linguistic data is not lost, but used to build AI that truly understands every Indian.

I have attached our whitepaper, *"SahayakAI: Architecting Universal Learning Equity,"* for your kind perusal.

Thank you for your leadership and time.

With deep respect,

**Abhishek Gupta**
Founder, SARGVISION AI
