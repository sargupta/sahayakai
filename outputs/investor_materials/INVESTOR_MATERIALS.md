## 2. TAM/SAM/SOM Analysis

### Total Addressable Market (TAM)

**India EdTech Market:** $10.4B USD (2025) [[1]](#sources)
- K-12 segment: 43% = **$4.47B USD**
- Teacher training & enablement: ~15% of K-12 = **$670M USD**

**Government School Teacher Base:**
- Total teachers in India: 9.7M (UDISE+ 2021-22) [[2]](#sources)
- Government school teachers: 4.9M [[3]](#sources)
- Rural/semi-urban teachers: 70%+ = **3.5M+ teachers**

**TAM Calculation:**
- 9.7M teachers × ₹1,000 (annual license) = **₹9,700 Crores ($118M USD)**
- Conservative institutional estimate = **₹9,700 Crores** (total addressable market)

### Serviceable Addressable Market (SAM)

**Focus: Government School Teachers (Pilot States)**
- Target teacher base in initial rollout: 4.9M government teachers
- Realistic 10% penetration (SOM) = 500,000 teachers
- SOM = 500,000 × ₹1,000 = **₹50 Crores initial annual opportunity**

**Key States (Top 5 by teacher count):**
1. Uttar Pradesh: 280,000 teachers
2. Bihar: 220,000 teachers
3. Madhya Pradesh: 180,000 teachers
4. West Bengal: 160,000 teachers
5. Rajasthan: 145,000 teachers

### Serviceable Obtainable Market (SOM)

**Year 5 Target (2030):** 3M teachers = **10.5% of TAM**

**Realistic Market Share:**
- In focused states: 25-40% penetration
- Overall India: 8-12% of government teacher base

**Competitive Position:**
- No direct "Bharat-First" B2G AI teaching assistant competitor
