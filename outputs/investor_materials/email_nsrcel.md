**Body:**

To the NSRCEL Impact Orbit Team,

I am writing to submit **SahayakAI** for consideration in your **Tech-Enabled Social Innovation** cohort.

**The Core Problem: Teacher Bandwidth & Efficiency**
Our research shows that the "Quality Gap" in rural education is fundamentally a "Teacher Bandwidth" problem. Teachers spend hours on administrative tasks, leaving little time for creative pedagogy.

**Our Solution: An AI Productivity Suite for Educators**
SahayakAI is not just a chatbot; it is a comprehensive **Pedagogical Assistant** designed to improve teacher efficiency and productivity through three core modules:
1.  **Lesson Planning:** Automates the creation of structured, curriculum-aligned lesson plans in seconds.
2.  **Quiz Generator:** Instantly creates formative assessments to check student understanding.
3.  **Visual Aid Designer:** Generates black-board style diagrams to explain complex concepts visually.

**Beyond Tools: Building a Community**
Just as the IT community thrives on platforms like StackOverflow, we are building a **"Community of Practice"** for rural teachers.
-   **Knowledge Sharing:** Teachers can share their best lesson plans and strategies.
-   **Peer Support:** An offline-mesh network allows teachers to solve each other's pedagogical challenges, fostering a culture of collective growth.

**Why NSRCEL?**
We need the mentorship of IIM Bangalore to help us structure this not just as a product, but as a scalable social impact institution. We want to learn how to measure and optimize for **Teacher Productivity** and **Learning Outcomes** at scale.

We are building the **Civilizational Intelligence Infrastructure** for the next billion learners. We would be honored to build it from IIM Bengaluru.

Warm regards,

**Abhishek Gupta**
Founder, SahayakAI
