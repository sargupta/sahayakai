# Slide 2: The Problem - India's "Quality Paradox"

## 🎓 Access Achieved, Quality Crisis Remains

India built 1.5M schools, but **rural learning outcomes are collapsing**.

### The Brutal Reality

| Urban Private School | Rural Government School |
|---------------------|------------------------|
| 8 hrs/week quality instruction | 2 hrs/week quality instruction |
| AI tools, digital libraries | Chalk & blackboard only |
| High teacher-student ratio | 1 teacher, 3 grades, 60 students |

### **The Root Cause: Overburdened Rural Teachers**

```
45 minutes      →     15 minutes
[Needed for     →     [Actual prep time
lesson prep]          available]
```

**3 Paralyzing Barriers:**
1. ❌ **Contextual Disconnect**: Urban-centric textbooks alienate village students
2. ❌ **Resource Poverty**: Zero connectivity, no teaching aids
3. ❌ **Administrative Overload**: Non-academic duties consume 80% of time

> **Impact:** 150M rural students are falling behind, creating a generational opportunity gap.

(Gravity lesson)                 ✓ Local examples (falling coconuts)
                                 ✓ NCERT curriculum-aligned
                                 ✓ Fully offline-capable
```
