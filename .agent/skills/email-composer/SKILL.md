# Email Composer

This skill enables the generation of emails that match the specific tone, style, and pattern of Abhishek Gupta (CEO, SARGVISION AI).

## Workflow

1.  **Context Discovery**: Use `search_web` to find the recipient's core intellectual thesis, recent publications, or public statements.
2.  **Style Alignment**: Read the [SARGVISION Style Guide](references/style-guide.md) to understand the forbidden cliches and core narrative pillars.
3.  **Drafting**: Construct the email following the "Hook-Problem-Solution-Proof-Ask" structure.
4.  **Polish**: Review the draft to ensure zero "AI signature" phrases remain.

## Tone Pillars

- **Direct Hooks**: Start with a punchy observation about the recipient's work.
- **Deterministic Terminology**: Use project-specific terms (e.g., "Agent Garden", "Sovereign AI", "Cognitive Exoskeleton") with precision.
- **Data-Backed Proof**: Always ground claims in specific metrics (traction, efficiency, learning hours).
- **Civilizational Narrative**: Tie the ask to the larger mission of "Universal Learning Equity."
