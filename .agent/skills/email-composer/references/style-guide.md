# SARGVISION Executive Style Guide: The Founder & CEO Voice

This guide codifies the communication standard for SARGVISION AI, reflecting the background of Abhishek Gupta as a Founder & CEO and former Senior Consultant at EY. The tone is authoritative, strategic, and profoundly respectful of shared intellectual rigor.

## 1. The Executive Profile
- **Identity**: Founder & CEO, SARGVISION AI.
- **Pedigree**: Ex-Senior Consultant, EY.
- **Tone**: Professional, data-driven, strategic, and "Civilizational."
- **Standard**: "Berkeley-Standard" + Big Four Executive Precision.

## 2. Forbidden "AI Signature" Tropes (The Professional Guardrail)

Eliminating these is non-negotiable for an executive-grade email:
- ❌ **The Generic Greeting**: "I hope this email finds you well." (Executives value time; be direct).
- ❌ **The "Observer" Opening**: "I see you are speaking," "I noticed your work," "I was looking at your profile." (This sounds like a student or an AI; lead with strategic context).
- ❌ **The "Reaching Out" Filler**: "I am reaching out because..." (Instead, just state the premise).
- ❌ **The Synergistic Cliché**: "Explore synergies," "Remarkably parallel," "Eager to connect."
- ❌ **The Passive Closing**: "Feel free to let me know." (Be direct about the next step).
- ❌ **The Over-Apologetic Tone**: Avoid signal-lowering phrases.

## 3. The "Executive Founder" Hook (BIG 4 Precision)

Every communication must start with a high-context, strategic anchor:
- **Foundational Research**: Reference a specific publication, session title, or intellectual thesis.
- **The "Broken Math" Thesis**: Use data-driven urgency. Consult EY-grade metrics (Efficiency, Scale, Optimization).
- **Deterministic Language**: Use proprietary terms (Agent Garden, Sovereign AI, Pedagogical OS) as defined industry categories, not "cool features."

## 4. Structure: The Strategic Briefing

1.  **Subject**: High-context, meeting-grade clarity.
2.  **The Anchor (Hook)**: A strategic observation about the recipient's work.
3.  **The Context (The 'Why')**: Why this meeting matters *now* (The "Civilizational Wait" or "Edge Discovery").
4.  **The Bridge**: A direct link between your A2A architecture and their domain (e.g., Space Autonomous Landing).
5.  **The Ask**: A clear, respectful, and time-bound request (15 min briefing).

## 5. Tone Comparison

| Context | Sub-Standard (Unprofessional/AI/Student) | Executive Standard (Founder/ex-EY) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Greeting** | "Hi Dr. Patil, I hope you're okay." | "Dear Dr. Patil," |
| **Opening** | "I see you are speaking at the summit." | "Your upcoming session at the AI Impact Summit regarding AI's role in space exploration provides a timely context for a technical discussion." |
| **Technical** | "Our AI is like what you do in space." | "I am architecting **SahayakAI**, a decentralized 'Agent Garden': a mission-critical Pedagogical OS for the Global South." |
| **Call to Action** | "Would be great to catch up if you can." | "I would value a 15-minute briefing to discuss the potential of applying our A2A (Agent-to-Agent) architecture to the space domain." |

## 6. Closing Protocol

- **Sign-off**: "Best regards," or "Sincerely,"
- **Signature**:
  Abhishek Gupta
  Founder & CEO, SARGVISION AI
  (Formerly Senior Consultant, EY)
