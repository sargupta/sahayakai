# Sahayakai: What Our Application Does

This document explains the different features of the Sahayakai platform and the AI "agents" that make them work. We've designed this guide to be easy to understand for everyone on the team, regardless of their technical background.

## What are AI Agents?

Think of our AI agents as smart assistants that are experts in specific educational tasks. Each agent is a specialized AI that has been trained to help teachers with a particular part of their job. When you use a feature in Sahayakai, you're actually interacting with one of these agents.
