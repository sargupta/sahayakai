# How to Track Teacher Activity by Email

**Last updated:** 2026-06-10 (verified: `teacher:lookup` npm script, `users` / `teacher_analytics` / `users/{uid}/content` collections all current).

## 🎯 Quick Answer

**You can track any teacher's activity using their email address!** Here's how:

### One-Line Command

```bash
npm run teacher:lookup priya@school.in
```

This will show you:
- ✅ Teacher's profile (name, school, grades, subjects)
- ✅ All content they've created
- ✅ Health score & engagement metrics
- ✅ Recent activity timeline

---

## 📊 How It Works

### Step 1: Teacher Registers with Email

When a teacher signs up:
```
Email: priya@school.in
Password: ••••••••
```

### Step 2: Firebase Creates Unique ID

Firebase generates a UID:
```
Email: priya@school.in
UID: nYqFxBohXrSaL3EBF1f3M2x0pLf2
```

### Step 3: Data is Stored with BOTH

```
users/nYqFxBohXrSaL3EBF1f3M2x0pLf2/
  email: "priya@school.in"         ← Search by this
  displayName: "Priya Sharma"
  schoolName: "Delhi Public School"
  ...

teacher_analytics/nYqFxBohXrSaL3EBF1f3M2x0pLf2/
  sessions_last_7_days: 5
  content_created: 12
  ...
```

### Step 4: Lookup by Email

Our script searches:
1. Find user where `email == "priya@school.in"`  
2. Get their `UID`
3. Fetch analytics using that `UID`

## 🔍 Alternative Methods

### Method 1: Direct Script (Recommended)

```bash
npm run teacher:lookup <email>
```

**Pros:** Fast, all info in one place  
**Cons:** Requires command line

---

### Method 2: Firebase Console

**URL:** https://console.firebase.google.com/project/sahayakai-b4248/firestore

**Steps:**
1. Go to `users` collection
2. Click "Start Collection"
3. Add filter: `email == priya@school.in`
4. Click on the matching document
5. Copy the document ID (that's the UID)
6. Go to `teacher_analytics` collection

### Method 3: API Endpoint (For Dashboards)

**For building an admin dashboard:**

```typescript
// 1. Search user by email
const usersRef = db.collection('users');
const snapshot = await usersRef
  .where('email', '==', 'priya@school.in')
  .limit(1)
  .get();

const userId = snapshot.docs[0].id;

// 2. Get their analytics
const analytics = await db
  .collection('teacher_analytics')
  .doc(userId)
  .get();

// 3. Get their content
const content = await db
  .collection('users')
  .doc(userId)
  .collection('content')
  .get();
```
