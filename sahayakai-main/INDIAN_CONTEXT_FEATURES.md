## 📚 Example Transformations

### **Mathematics Problem - Before:**
> "If John buys 3 pizzas at $12 each, how much does he spend?"

### **Mathematics Problem - After:**
> "If a farmer harvests 250 kg of wheat from one bigha and sells it at ₹25 per kg, how much money does he earn?"

---

### **Science Lesson - Before:**
> "Observe how snow melts when temperature rises above 0°C"

### **Science Lesson - After:**
> "Observe how water evaporates faster during summer heat (45°C) compared to monsoon season"

---

### **Geography Example - Before:**
> "The Mississippi River flows through the United States..."

### **Geography Example - After:**
> "The Ganga River flows through North India, providing water for farming in Uttar Pradesh, Bihar..."

```
Activity: Watch a video on YouTube about photosynthesis
Materials needed: Computer, Projector, Internet connection
```

**After (Zero-cost):**
```
Activity: Draw the photosynthesis process on blackboard
Materials needed: Chalk, Blackboard
Alternative: Students can draw in their notebooks using pencil
Real-world connection: Observe plants in the school garden or nearby fields
```

## 🌾 Agricultural Context Integration

### **Why Agriculture?**
- 60%+ rural families depend on farming
- Students understand farming cycles, crops, seasons
- Makes abstract concepts concrete

### **Examples:**

**Mathematics:**
- Area calculation → Field measurement (bigha, katha)
- Profit/Loss → Crop selling, fertilizer costs
- Percentages → Crop yield increase, loan interest

**Science:**
- Seasons → Kharif, Rabi, Zaid crops
- Water cycle → Monsoon, irrigation, wells
- Plants → Wheat, rice, sugarcane growth

**Social Studies:**
- Economics → Agricultural markets, MSP
- Geography → Soil types, rainfall patterns
- History → Green Revolution, farmer movements

## 🇮🇳 Indian Cultural References

### **Festivals Used in Examples:**
- **Diwali** - Mathematics (budget, sweets distribution)
- **Holi** - Science (colors, mixing)
- **Eid** - Social harmony, community
- **Pongal/Baisakhi** - Harvest festivals, agriculture
- **Makar Sankranti** - Seasons, kite flying physics

### **Daily Life Scenarios:**
- Morning routines (fetching water, helping parents)
- School activities (mid-day meal, morning assembly)
- Village life (markets, fairs, community gatherings)
- Transportation (bus, bicycle, bullock cart)

### **Indian Heroes Referenced:**
- **Mahatma Gandhi** - Non-violence, freedom struggle
- **APJ Abdul Kalam** - Science, inspiration
- **C.V. Raman** - Physics, Nobel Prize
- **Bhagat Singh** - Courage, patriotism
- **Savitribai Phule** - Education, women's rights

## 🔍 Technical Implementation

### **Files Modified:**
1. `src/lib/indian-context.ts` - Indian examples database
2. `src/ai/flows/lesson-plan-generator.ts` - AI prompt updates
3. `src/app/lesson-plan/page.tsx` - Enable by default

### **How It Works:**
```typescript
// When useRuralContext = true (default)
const prompt = `
Use Indian examples:
- Food: roti, dal, rice (not pizza, burger)
- Weather: monsoon, heat wave (not snow)
- Currency: ₹ (not $)
- Geography: Ganga, Himalayas (not foreign locations)
- Assume: chalk & blackboard only
- Context: farming, rural life
`;
```

## 💡 Example Lesson Plan (Before vs After)

### **Topic: "Fractions" - Grade 5 Mathematics**

#### **Before (Generic/Western):**
```
Topic: Understanding Fractions

Example: If you cut a pizza into 8 slices and eat 3 slices...

Materials Needed:
- Projector to show video
- Printed worksheets (1 per student)
- Fraction manipulatives

Activity: Watch online video about fractions
```

#### **After (Indian Rural Context):**
```
Topic: Understanding Fractions (भिन्न समझना)

Example: If a farmer divides his 1 bigha field into 4 equal parts 
and plants wheat in 3 parts, what fraction is planted?

Materials Needed:
- Chalk and blackboard
- Locally available items (stones, sticks, leaves)

Activities:
1. Draw rectangles on blackboard, divide into parts
2. Use stones to show fractions (3 out of 4 stones)
3. Real-world: If you have ₹10 and spend ₹3, what fraction is left?
4. Farming example: Kharif crops on 2/3 of field, Rabi on 1/3

Connection to Daily Life:
- Sharing rotis among family members
- Dividing field for different crops
- Calculating portion of harvest to sell vs keep
```
