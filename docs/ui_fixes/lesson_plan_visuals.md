# Visual Overhaul Log: Lesson Plan Page

**Date**: Dec 15, 2025

## 3.3 Visual Polish (World Class)
-   **Structure**: Removed the generic `Card` container. Replaced with a **"Floating Glass Sheet"** (`backdrop-blur-2xl`, `bg-white/60`, `rounded-3xl`).
-   **Lighting**: Added an ambient `orange-400/20` glow behind the main interface to give depth and warmth (matches brand).
-   **Typography**: Upgraded the main prompt from "What do you want to teach?" (1.25rem) to **"What do you want to teach today?"** (3rem+, Gradient Text). This creates a "Studio" feel.
-   **Input**: Replaced standard border input with a **"Floating Search Hero"** (Height: 20, Deep Shadow, No Border). Matches modern AI tools like Perplexity/Gemini.
-   **Sidebar**: Reduced visual weight. Changed header to small caps "CONFIGURATION" to denote it as secondary utility.

## Why?
-   Erodes the "Form Filling" mental model.
-   Invites creativity.
-   "Cutting Edge" requires breaking out of the 1px-border-box paradigm.
