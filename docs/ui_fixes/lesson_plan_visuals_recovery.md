# Visual Recovery: Structured Minimalism

**Date**: Dec 15, 2025

## Error Analysis ("Dumbing Ground")
-   The "Glass Studio" design removed too many boundaries.
-   Elements floated without anchors, making the UI look scattered ("Dumping Ground").
-   The "Glow" added visual noise.

## The Fix: "Structure & Clarity"
-   **Container**: Restored solid `bg-white` card with `border-slate-200`. No more "floaty" glass.
-   **Sidebar**: Gave it a distinct `bg-slate-50` panel. This visually separates "Input" (White) from "Config" (Grey). classic master-detail pattern.
-   **Typography**: Removed gradient text. Used solid `text-slate-900` for readability.
-   **Inputs**: Restored borders. Borders help users know where to click.

## Goal
-   Look like a **Professional Tool** (Linear, Vercel, Stripe dashboard), not a "Creative Website".
