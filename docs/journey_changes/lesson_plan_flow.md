# Customer Journey Correction: Lesson Plan Flow

**Date**: Dec 15, 2025

## 2.1 The "Mobile Scroll" Friction
-   **Problem**: Mobile users had to scroll past 6 input fields in the Sidebar just to hit "Generate" after typing a topic.
-   **Fix**: Moved the primary "Generate Lesson Plan" button inside the Left/Top layout column.
-   **Result**: On Mobile, the flow is now Topic -> Mic -> Image -> **Generate**. The Settings are visually *below* the action, optional.

## 2.2 Cognitive Load Reduction
-   **Problem**: Sidebar showed "Resources", "Difficulty", and "Chapter" immediately, creating a "Form-Filling" mindset.
-   **Fix**: Grouped these under an "Advanced Settings" accordion.
-   **Default State**: Only "Grade" and "Language" (Crucial context) are visible.
-   **Result**: Cleaner interface; users feel less overwhelmed.
