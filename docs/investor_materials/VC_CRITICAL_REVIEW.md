**Recommendation:** SEE CONCLUSION

---

## Executive Summary

**Investment Opportunity:**  
SahayakAI is building an offline-first AI teaching assistant targeting 9.7M Indian teachers (₹9,700 Cr TAM). Current traction: 150+ teachers in Karnataka pilot with 78% retention, partnered with independent regional validation. Seeking ₹2.3 Cr seed funding.

**Preliminary Assessment:**  
⚠️ **MIXED SIGNALS** - Strong technical differentiation and founder capability, BUT significant execution risks in B2G sales and overly aggressive growth projections. Requires major diligence before investment decision.

---

## Detailed Analysis

### 1. FINANCIAL VIABILITY (40% weight) - SCORE: **5/10** ⚠️

#### Revenue Projections

**Claimed:**  
- Year 1: 50,000 teachers → ₹3.0 Cr
- Year 5: 3,000,000 teachers → ₹225 Cr
- 5-year total: ₹405.5 Cr

**Red Flags:**

❌ **Assumption 1: 50K teachers in Year 1 is OVERLY AGGRESSIVE**
- Current traction: 150 teachers (Karnataka pilot)
- Claims: 333x growth in 12 months (150 → 50,000)
- Reality: Government procurement cycles are 12-18 months
- **Our Assessment:** 10-15K teachers Year 1 is more realistic (still impressive 66-100x growth)

❌ **Assumption 2:  Year 5 = 3M teachers (30% of TAM) is UNREALISTIC**
- EdTech penetration typically hits 5-10% TAM in mature markets
- Government adoption (laggard category) rarely exceeds 15% in 5 years
- **Our Assessment:** 500K-750K teachers by Year 5 is achievable (5-8% TAM)

**Revised Revenue Model (Conservative):**

| Year | Teachers (Realistic) | Revenue (₹ Cr) | vs. Founders' Projection |
|------|----------------------|----------------|--------------------------|
| 2026 | 10,000 (not 50K) | 0.6 (not 3.0) | -80% |
| 2027 | 50,000 (not 250K) | 3.25 (not 16.25) | -80% |
| 2028 | 150,000 (not 750K) | 10.5 (not 52.5) | -80% |
| 2029 | 350,000 (not 1.5M) | 24.5 (not 108.75) | -77% |
| 2030 | 600,000 (not 3M) | 42 (not 225) | -81% |

**Revised 5-Year Total:** ₹81 Cr (vs. claimed ₹405.5 Cr)

✅ **Positive:** Even at 20% of projections, this is a ₹80+ Cr revenue business (attractive exit potential)  
⚠️ **Concern:** Founder may be over-optimistic, lacks B2G sales experience to validate timelines

---

#### Unit Economics

**Claimed:**  
- LTV: ₹2,900 (Year 3)
- CAC: ₹650 (Year 3)
- LTV:CAC: 4.5:1 ✅ (Target >3:1)
- Gross Margin: 66%

**Our Assessment:** ✅ **CREDIBLE IF ACHIEVED**

**Strengths:**
- COGS breakdown is detailed and justifiable (Gemini API ₹120, Cloud ₹50, etc.)
- Semantic caching (68% hit rate) is technically sound cost reduction strategy
- B2G model = low churn assumption (2%) is reasonable (government mandates stick)

**Risks:**
- CAC assumes government "zero user acquisition cost" → **FALSE**
  - B2G requires: lobbying (₹2-5 L/state), pilot execution (₹10-15 L), tender consultants
  - Realistic CAC (Year 3): ₹1,200-1,500 (not ₹650)
  - **Impact:** LTV:CAC drops to 2-2.4:1 (still acceptable, but not 4.5:1)

**Verdict:** Unit economics are SOUND in principle, but CAC is underestimated by 50-100%

---

#### Path to Profitability

**Claimed:** Breakeven at Month 21 (Q3 FY 2027)

**Our Assessment:** ⚠️ **OPTIMISTIC - More likely Month 30-36**

**Issues:**
1. Revenue ramp is back-loaded (government contracts take 18+ months to close)
2. OpEx burn of ₹26.34 L/month (Year 1) with only ₹3 Cr revenue = ₹1.36 Cr annual burn
3. ₹2.3 Cr funding provides ~18-20 month runway (not 24 months as implied)

**Downside Scenario:**
- If Year 1 revenue is ₹0.6 Cr (our realistic case), not ₹3 Cr:
  - Annual burn: ₹3.76 Cr (OpEx ₹3.16 Cr + COGS ₹0.6 Cr)
  - **Runway: 7-8 months only** ⚠️⚠️⚠️ **CRITICAL ISSUE**

**Founder Must Address:**
- How will company survive if first government contract takes 18 months?
- Bridge funding plan? Cost cuts? Freemium pivot?

---

### 2. MARKET SIZING (25% weight) - SCORE: **7/10** ✅

#### TAM/SAM/SOM Calculation

**Claimed:**
- TAM: ₹9,700 Cr (9.7M teachers × ₹1,000/year)
- SAM: ₹4,900 Cr (4.9M govt teachers)
- SOM (Year 1): ₹50 Cr (500K teachers, 10%)

**Our Validation:**

✅ **TAM is ACCURATE**
- UDISE+ 2021-22: 9.7M teachers confirmed
- Pricing (₹1,000/year) is reasonable for B2G budgets
- Government edu-tech allocation: ₹500 Cr nationally (FY26) supports demand

✅ **SAM is CONSERVATIVE** (Good sign)
- Focusing on  government teachers (50% of total) is smart
- Private schools unlikely to adopt (already have resources)

❌ **SOM (Year 1) is OVERSTATED**
- 500K teachers = 10% of SAM in **Year 1** is unrealistic
- Comparable: DIKSHA took 5 years to reach 4.5M teachers (with government mandate)
- **Realistic SOM (Year 1):** 10-20K teachers (0.2-0.4% of SAM)

**Verdict:** Market size is REAL and LARGE, but penetration timeline is overly aggressive

---

#### Market Timing

**Claimed:** "Perfect storm" - NEP 2020, NITI Aayog framework, ₹500 Cr budget

**Our Assessment:** ✅ **TIMING IS ACTUALLY STRONG**

**Validation:**
- NEP 2020 mandates multilingual, tech-enabled education ✅
- NITI Aayog outcomes-based procurement (2024) favors measurable impact ✅
- Union Budget FY26: ₹500 Cr for AI in Education ✅ (verified in government docs)

**Competitive Window:**
- Large EdTech (BYJU's, Unacademy) are distressed (layoffs, valuation cuts)
- US EdTech (Flint, Khanmigo) not India-focused
- **Reality:** 12-24 month first-mover window EXISTS

**Verdict:** Macro tailwinds are REAL and favorable

---

### 3. PRODUCT & TECH (20% weight) - SCORE: **8/10** ✅✅

#### Technical Differentiation

**Claimed:** 3 core innovations - Voice-First, Offline-First, Bharat-First Context Engine

**Our Assessment:** ✅ **GENUINELY DIFFERENTIATED**

**Strengths:**
1. **Offline Hybrid Architecture (18+ months R&D):**
   - PWA + IndexedDB + Service Workers is non-trivial
   - 89% uptime in low-connectivity zones (pilot validated)
   - **Competitive Moat:** High barrier to entry (requires deep PWA expertise)

2. **Voice-First Interface (94% transcription accuracy):**
   - Karnataka pilot: 75%+ teachers prefer voice over typing
   - Removes digital literacy barrier (critical for rural adoption)
   - **User Love:** Teachers stated "would abandon if internet-dependent"

3. **Bharat-First Context Engine (50K+ local examples):**
   - Proprietary database (2+ years curation) is a DATA MOAT
   - Network effects: More teachers → Better cache → Lower costs
   - **Defensibility:** Copycats need similar teacher base to replicate

**Weaknesses:**
- Dependency on Google Gemini API (vendor lock-in risk)
  - Mitigation claimed: Multi-model support by 2028 (Llama, Mistral)
  - **Our View:** Reasonable, but execution risk remains

**Verdict:** Technical moats are REAL and SUSTAINABLE (this is a strong differentiator)

---

#### Scalability

**Concern:** Can architecture support 3M teachers?

**Founder Claims:**
- Serverless Firebase scales automatically
- Semantic caching reduces API calls by 68%
- Reference: ARCHITECTURE_REVIEW.md shows 1M+ user capacity

**Our Assessment:** ⚠️ **NEEDS VALIDATION**
- Firebase scales, BUT at cost (per-read pricing can spike)
- 3M teachers × 50 lessons/year = 150M API calls/year
  - Even with 68% cache: 48M Gemini calls
  - At ₹2.4/call = ₹11.5 Cr annual AI costs alone
  - **Question:** Does COGS model account for this at scale?

**Due Diligence Required:**
- Stress test: Run 10K concurrent voice transcriptions
- Cost model: Validate Gemini API pricing at 100M+ calls/year

---

### 4. TEAM & EXECUTION (15% weight) - SCORE: **6/10** ⚠️

#### Founder Capability

**Abhishek Gupta** - Founder & CEO

**Strengths:**
- 9 years AI/ML experience ✅
- Erasmus Mundus Scholar, NASA Global Nominee (credibility) ✅
- Built multi-agent AI video production pipeline (relevant technical expertise) ✅
- NITI Aayog finalist (government credibility) ✅

**Weaknesses:**
- ❌ **Zero B2G sales experience** (critical gap for government contracts)
- ❌ **No education sector background** (EdTech is domain-specific)
- ❌ **Solo founder** (single point of failure, no co-founder to cover gaps)

**Competitive Comparison:**
- BYJU's founder: Teacher for 10+ years before starting company
- Unacademy founders: Educator + IIT pedigree + multiple co-founders
- **SahayakAI:** Technical founder with no domain/sales co-founder

**Verdict:** ⚠️ **FOUNDER IS CAPABLE BUT INCOMPLETE TEAM**

---

#### Key Hire Plan

**Planned Hires (Seed Round):**
1. Senior AI Engineer (Month 1)
2. Government Relations Manager (Month 3) ← **CRITICAL**
3. Head of Pedagogy (Month 6)
4. Mobile Lead - Flutter (part-time → full-time)
5. Field Operations Manager (Month 9)

**Our Assessment:** ✅ **HIRE PLAN IS SOUND**

**Strengths:**
- Government Relations Manager (Hire #2) addresses founder's B2G gap
- Head of Pedagogy (Hire #3) brings education domain expertise
- Timeline (Month 1-9) is realistic for seed-stage hiring

**Concerns:**
- All hires are "planned" - none are committed/LOI'd
- Hire #2 (Govt Relations) is MOST CRITICAL but comes Month 3 (should be Month 1)
  - **Risk:** First 3 months of runway burned without B2G expertise

**Recommendation:**  
Condition investment on Govt Relations Manager LOI/hire commitment

---

### 5. COMPETITIVE POSITION - SCORE: **7/10** ✅

#### Competitive Landscape

**Claimed:** "No direct Bharat-First B2G competitor"

**Our Validation:** ✅ **MOSTLY TRUE**

**Verified:**
- Flint (YC): Cloud-only, Western-centric, B2C ✅
- GradeWiz (YC): Grading-focused, not content creation ✅
- DIKSHA (Govt): Static repository, no AI generation ✅
- ChatGPT: General AI, not curriculum-aligned ✅

**Missing from Analysis:**
- **Potential Threat: Google Classroom AI features** (2026 roadmap?)
  - Google could bundle Gemini into Classroom for free
  - **Mitigation:** India-specific features (local context, NCERT) still differentiate
- **Potential Threat: Microsoft Teams Education + Copilot**
  - Similar risk as Google
  - **Mitigation:** Offline-first is unique (cloud players can't easily replicate)

**Verdict:** Competitive moats are REAL for now, but large tech platforms are a 2-3 year threat

---

### 6. GO-TO-MARKET STRATEGY - SCORE: **5/10** ⚠️

#### "Anchor & Expand" B2G Playbook

**Claimed Strategy:**
1. Pilot (2026): 1 state → 5,000 teachers
2. Validate (2027): 2 state contracts
3. Expand (2028): 5 states → 50,000 teachers
4. Ecosystem (2030): DIKSHA integration → 500K+ teachers

**Our Assessment:** ⚠️ **LOGICAL BUT EXECUTION-RISKY**

**Strengths:**
- "Land & expand" is correct B2G approach ✅
- Karnataka pilot (independent regional validation) is strong proof point ✅
- DIKSHA integration strategy is smart (4.5M teacher reach) ✅

**Critical Gaps:**

❌ **No Named Government Decision-Makers**
- Deck mentions "MoUs in discussion" (Karnataka, UP, WB)
- **Reality Check:** "In discussion" ≠ Committed
- **Due Diligence:** Who are the actual IAS officers/education secretaries engaged?

❌ **Sales Cycle Risk Underestimated**
- Founder assumes 9-18 month sales cycle
- **Reality (our portfo experience):** First govt contract = 18-24 months, renewals = 12 months
- **Impact:** Revenue timeline slides right by 6-12 months

❌ **Pilot-to-Contract Conversion Rate Assumed 100%**
- Not all pilots convert to paid contracts (govt budget constraints, politics)
- Industry benchmark: 40-60% pilot conversion
- **Risk:** Karnataka pilot may not convert to state-wide contract

**Recommendation:**  
Require pilot MoU signatures (not just "in discussion") as funding milestone

---

### 7. TRACTION & VALIDATION - SCORE: **7/10** ✅

#### Karnataka Pilot (Quantitative)

**Claimed Metrics:**
- 150+ teachers onboarded
- 78% retention (3 months)
- 45 min → 5 min time savings
- 92% curriculum alignment
- NPS: 71

**Our Validation:** ✅ **CREDIBLE AND IMPRESSIVE**

**Strengths:**
- Academic partner (independent regional validation) adds credibility ✅
- 78% retention is strong for B2G pilot (>60% benchmark) ✅
- NPS 71 is "Excellent" (>50 is good, >70 is exceptional) ✅

**Concerns:**
- Sample size: 150 teachers is small (need 500+ for statistical significance)
- Duration: 3 months is short (need 6-12 month retention data)
- Geography: Karnataka only (need multi-state validation)

**Due Diligence Required:**
- Interview 5-10 pilot teachers directly (verify testimonials)
- Request independent regional validation impact study (peer-reviewed?)

---

#### Case Study (Qualitative)

**Claimed:** 30 teachers (intervention) vs. 30 teachers (control)

**Results:**
- Test scores: +11.8% improvement
- Teacher prep time: -88%
- Student engagement: +24%

**Statistical significance:** p=0.012 (95% confidence)

**Our Assessment:** ✅ **IF TRUE, THIS IS COMPELLING**

**Validation Needed:**
- Who conducted the study? (Dr. Ramdas Pai Chair - need to verify independence)
- Pre-registered study design? (protects against p-hacking)
- Raw data available for third-party analysis?

**Verdict:** Traction is REAL but needs independent academic validation for fundraising credibility

---

## CRITICAL RED FLAGS 🚩

### 1. Runway Mathematics Don't Add Up ⚠️⚠️⚠️ **DEALBREAKER**

**Founder Claims:**  
₹2.3 Cr provides "18+ month runway"

**Our Calculation:**
- Monthly burn: ₹26.34 L (OpEx) + ₹10 L (COGS @10K teachers) = ₹36 L/month
- ₹2.3 Cr ÷ ₹36 L/month = **~6 months runway** (not 18 months)

**Explanation of Discrepancy:**
- Founder assumes ₹3 Cr Year 1 revenue (offsets burn)
- **Reality:** If government contracts take 18 months, Year 1 revenue = ₹0
- **Actual Runway:** 6-8 months before bridge round needed

**Investor Risk:**  
Without revenue in first 12 months, company runs out of cash before breakeven

**Required Mitigation:**
- Founder must have bridge funding plan (CSR grants committed?)
- OR reduce burn rate to ₹15-18 L/month (delay hires, cut marketing)
- OR demonstrate 2-3 government LOIs signed (de-risk revenue timeline)

---

### 2. Solo Founder with No B2G Experience 🚩

**Reality:**  
Founder is brilliant technically, BUT has zero experience:
- Selling to government (complex procurement, political relationships)
- Education sector domain knowledge (curriculum design, teacher training)

**Risk:**
- Government sales require 5-10 years of relationship-building
- Education requires deep pedagogical expertise (not just AI)

**Mitigation:**
- Hire #2 (Govt Relations Manager) is critical - MUST be in place before funding
- Advisory Board needs former IAS officer/education secretary (not just "to be recruited")

---

### 3. Financial Projections Are 5x Too Aggressive 🚩

**Summary:**
- Founder projects ₹405 Cr (5 years)
- Realistic: ₹80-100 Cr (5 years)
- **Delta:** 4-5x over-projection

**Impact on Valuation:**
- If exit is based on 5x revenue multiple:
  - Founder's model: ₹225 Cr (Y5) × 5 = ₹1,125 Cr exit
  - Realistic: ₹42 Cr (Y5) × 5 = ₹210 Cr exit
- **Valuation gap:** 5x difference

**Concern:**  
Over-optimism suggests founder lacks B2G market understanding OR is overselling

---

## POSITIVE SIGNALS ✅

### 1. Technical Differentiation is REAL ✅✅

- Offline-first architecture is genuinely hard to copy (18+ months R&D)
- Voice-first + Bharat-First context = unique combo
- 68% semantic caching is cost moat (improves with scale)

**This is NOT vaporware** - pilot proves technology works

---

### 2. Market Timing is Strong ✅✅

- NEP 2020, NITI Aayog outcomes framework, ₹500 Cr government budget = all verified
- EdTech competitors distressed (BYJU's, Unacademy) = opportunity window
- Rural India tech adoption inflection point (320M+ smartphones)

---

### 3. Pilot Traction is Impressive for 6 Months ✅

- 150 teachers, 78% retention, NPS 71 = exceptional early metrics
- Academic partnership (Chanakya) = credibility
- Teacher testimonials are authentic (we can verify)

---

## INVESTMENT RECOMMENDATION

### RATING: **HOLD - Further Due Diligence Required** ⚠️

**Rationale:**

**Strong Foundation:**
- ✅ Real technical differentiation (offline-first, voice-first, Bharat-first)
- ✅ Genuine market opportunity (₹9,700 Cr TAM, government tailwinds)
- ✅ Early traction validates product-market fit (78% retention, NPS 71)

**Critical Execution Risks:**
- 🚩 Runway mathematics don't support 18-month timeline (6-8 months realistic)
- 🚩 Solo founder with zero B2G experience (needs immediate co-founder/hire)
- 🚩 Revenue projections 4-5x too aggressive (unrealistic government penetration)

---

### INVESTMENT DECISION FRAMEWORK

#### PASS IF:
- Founder cannot reconcile burn rate / runway discrepancy
- Government MoUs remain "in discussion" (no signatures/LOIs)
- Govt Relations Manager hire not committed by Month 1

#### PROCEED TO INVESTMENT COMMITTEE IF:
- ✅ Founder commits to ₹15 L/month burn rate (extend runway to 15 months)
- ✅ 1-2 government LOIs signed (de-risk revenue timeline)
- ✅ Govt Relations Manager hire committed (name + start date)
- ✅ independent field studies independently validated

#### INVESTMENT TERMS (If Approved):

**Amount:** ₹2.3 Crores  
**Valuation:** ₹8-10 Crores post-money (20-25% equity)  
**Structure:** Convertible note with:
- **Milestone 1:** Release ₹1.2 Cr upon Govt Relations Manager hire + 1 state LOI
- **Milestone 2:** Release ₹1.1 Cr upon 10,000 teachers onboarded OR 12 months (whichever first)

**Board Seat:** Yes (investor observer rights minimum)  
**Liquidation Preference:** 1x non-participating  
**Anti-Dilution:** Weighted average

---

### ALTERNATIVE RECOMMENDATION: BRIDGE INVESTMENT

If founder is unable to meet above milestones immediately:

**Offer:** ₹50 Lakhs bridge (convertible note)  
**Purpose:** Hire Govt Relations Manager + secure 1 government LOI  
**Timeline:** 6 months to achieve milestones  
**Conversion:** Converts to seed round (₹2.3 Cr) upon milestone achievement

**Rationale:**  
- De-risks our investment by validating B2G sales capability
- Gives founder runway to prove government traction
- Smaller check limits downside if execution fails

---

## CONCLUSION

SahayakAI has **exceptional technology** and is attacking a **real, large market** with **genuine government tailwinds**. The founder is **technically brilliant** and has built **authentic early traction**.

HOWEVER, this is a **EXECUTION-RISKY INVESTMENT** due to:
1. Solo founder with no B2G experience
2. Overly aggressive financial projections
3. Runway/burn rate mathematics that don't support 18-month timeline

**RECOMMENDED PATH:**  
Offer ₹50 L bridge round contingent on:
- Govt Relations Manager hire (Month 1)
- 1 state government LOI (Month 4-6)

IF milestones achieved → Proceed with full ₹2.3 Cr seed at ₹10 Cr post-money

**Final Grade:** **C+ (Conditional Proceed with Caution)**

---

**Prepared By:** Senior Partner, EdTech/India Practice  
**Review Date:** January 27, 2026  
**Next Steps:** Schedule founder Q&A to address runway discrepancy and government pipeline
